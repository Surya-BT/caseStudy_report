# Case Study on the spread of COVID-19 in South Korea
In this case study, I used data visualization techniques to explore different factors that influenced the COVID-19 spread in South Korea.
The following factors were used in this study:
+ Weather - Temperature, humidity, etc
+ Patient details - Age, Gender, etc
+ Population - density, number of schools, colleges, etc

The data used in this study was taken from Kaggle.com

Then with the help of statistical tools, I determined the correlation between these factors and the cause of COVID-19.
From the data, It was found that age had a positive correlation with the number of cases

Also, I was able to eliminate the false correlations in the data. 
For example, gender and the number of cases
